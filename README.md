A spotify web app that gives you a colorful record based on your listening activity
<br>
Will soon give you a song recommendation that you can directly play on the page

### What i am currently working on:
- Using the spotify playback sdk to play the song recommendation
- add parameters using the listening data to make the record prettier
- make the app suitable for phones
- add a loading page
